BUGS
----

- automatic refresh does not work on NVIDIA GK208BM (GeForce 920M) with 
nvidia-driver-* on GNU/Linux. As far as I can say, this is an NVIDIA
driver problem.

- in Raspbian 10 for ARM, the 'p' letter is drawn incorrectly in
SCRIPT_FONT. The bug does not affect Raspbian 10 for i386.
Reported by Ioulianos Kakoulidis.

Please report bugs if you find any.
